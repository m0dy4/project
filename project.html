    The idea of establishing Al Ahly in the first decade of the 20th 
    century was raised by Omar Lotfy during his presidency 
    of the High School Students Club which was established 
    in 1905.The establishment of the club of high school students was
    for political reasons, and found that these students needed a sports 
    club that gathers them for leisure and exercise.He discussed the idea 
    of establishing the club with a group of friends who were enthusiastic
    about it, and in 1907 Al Ahly was established.
